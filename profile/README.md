The UXID Lab (User Experience and Interaction Design Lab) at Ontario Tech University is dedicated to advancing research in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and related fields. Our lab's work spans a range of interdisciplinary projects, with a strong focus on enhancing user experience through innovative design. We explore the intersections of AI and HCI, specifically in human-AI interaction, where we examine how artificial intelligence can be designed to better understand and support users' needs. Our team is also active in information visualization and interaction design, creating intuitive and effective ways to present complex data across various digital interfaces, including wearables. By investigating how users interact with wearable technologies, we aim to improve the usability and accessibility of these devices in everyday life. The UXID Lab is proud to have a diverse group of students, researchers, and collaborators, whose varied backgrounds and perspectives drive our mission to push the boundaries of interaction design and ensure technology is more responsive and beneficial to users.
